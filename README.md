CRYPTO CURRENCY PRICE TICKER with 24 candlesticks chart for M5Stack

###SD-Card Version with configuation file###
only needs config file "ccticker.cfg" on root of SD-Card
 
receiving WiFi data from Binance API/Websocket_v3 - by frittna (https://github.com/frittna/Crypto_Coin_Ticker)

This will show 24 candles, the min/max price and the volume as line, date and time are from time.nist.gov timeserver.
For M5-Stack MCU , coded in ArduinoIDE 1.8.14 - last modified Nov.21.2024 12:00 CET - Version 1.0.54 using spiffs + SDconfig

last change: *added* fixed format for prices over 100K$ because BTC might pass it soon ;)

previous edits: -> changed back to "api.binance.com" instead of "data.binance.com" (not in US-Version)
                -> added Timezone for: UTC, Arizona, Moscow
                -> "stream.binance.com" to "data-stream.binance.com" and "api.binance.com" to "data.binance.com" (not in US-Version)
                -> added cycling function (ButtonA+ButtonC together) which steps through your currencies after a certain time (default: 15sec for each)
                -> added Timezone for Singapore (UTC+8)
                -> minor changings: - code merged to one version, so there is no need to have different versions anymore !
                                    - autodetect the optional room sensor and show a 12px high sensor panel in case
                                    - temperature unit C or F and an temperature offset is set from SD-Config file and not hardcoded anymore
                                      (because the M5-Stack is heating up itself it will never be accurate and has only limited expressiveness)

#Using the App:

###############

This version needs a SD-Card whith the your WiFi credentials, favourite coinpairs, timezone and language(eng/ger/esp) in a textfile - see installation

ButtonA: switches through your favourite Coinpair (as many you want) e.g: BTC/USDT etc. which are available on Binance.com

ButtonB: changes the LCD-Brightness in 4 levels

ButtonC: 9 changeable Timeframes from 1 Minute to 1 Month

turn OFF the device pressing the red Button once OR by holding ButtonC for over 1 second

Press ButtonC, then, within 2 sec press ButtonA to switch down, or ButtonB to switch up through the timeframes: 1min->15mins->1hour->..

available timeframes are 1minute, 3m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w, 1Month

if you hold ButtonC at Startup: it will start with alternative SSID2/WiFi2-password instead (e.g your mobile phone's hotspot)

press ButtonA and ButtonC together to enable/disable cycling through all currencies after a set time (default:off, when turned on default:15sec)

#Further description:

#####################


The top infoPanel shows the WiFi-strength, batterylevel, colored indicators for "busy", SleepTimer, price moving and if charging from usb (can have delay up to 30s)

right now: english, german, spanish Language (day and month names)

SleepTimer: when holding ButtonB longer than 1,5 seconds it will start a user defined timer to powerOFF the device

If WiFi is failing more than 2 minutes it reduces the reconnect interval and brightness level, after 10 minutes -> shutdown device

Menu Loader compatible, if SD-Updater (menu.bin) is installed in your SD-Card hold ButtonA while booting up to start MenuLoader to load your apps

It is prepared for the use of a Neopixel RGB-LED bar (i use the built-in one in the Battery-Bottom Module for M5Stack/Fire with rgb 10 LEDs)

All settings will remain stored in internal memory after a reset so you can eject the SD-Card after setting up you favourites.

If you want to clear all stored settings from internal memory hold ButtonB at start-up.

If M5-Stack is in his BTC stand (the original grey vertical stand) the internal SHT room sensor is found and shows temp and humidity.
